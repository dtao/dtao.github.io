            <h1>Default parameters in Ruby</h1>
            <p>The idiomatic way of providing default parameter values in Ruby is to use the language&#39;s built-in facility:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def foo(options=DEFAULT_OPTIONS)
  do_something(options[:bar])
end
</code></pre>

<p>I actually prefer doing things slightly differently, though it might make some Ruby programmers unhappy:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def foo(options=nil)
  options ||= DEFAULT_OPTIONS.dup
  do_something(options[:bar])
end
</code></pre>

<p>There are two reasons for this. Well, three: one good and two sort of silly. I&#39;ll start with the silly ones.</p>

<h2>Reason 1: I want to be different</h2>

<p>Let me just put my cards out there. Any time I decide to write about a point of view that differs from the norm, at least a tiny fraction of the reason is just to be different. Admittedly a stupid reason, but there it is.</p>

<h2>Reason 2: The idiomatic way is open to side effects</h2>

<p>The idiomatic way, where you have <code>options=DEFAULT_OPTIONS</code>, causes a default object to be passed in to the method, which can cause unexpected behavior if you get mutate-happy with your Ruby:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def foo(options=DEFAULT_OPTIONS)
  # In the default case, you&#39;re changing DEFAULT_OPTIONS here!
  options.merge!(some_other_options())
  do_something(options)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, before you jump on me for this one, yes, I <em>do</em> realize that this is arguably a ridiculous objection, for one simple reason: there&#39;s really no difference between the &quot;idiomatic&quot; way and the &quot;Dan&quot; way here. In Ruby, you can easily set <code>options=DEFAULT_OPTIONS.dup</code> as your default parameter and avoid this problem. Likewise, using my preferred approach, you could easily forget to include the <code>.dup</code> and have the exact same problem.</p>

<p>My reason for preferring the use of <code>||=</code> here still stands, despite this very valid objection. I rarely see <code>.dup</code> called on a default parameter in Ruby in practice, and so I suspect most devs wouldn&#39;t even think about that part.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also counterintuitive to me that this isn&#39;t just a one-time setting of a default value; the default value is treated as an <em>expression</em> which will be evaluated whenever the method is called. To understand what I mean, consider this simple program:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">@counter = 0

def get_id
  @counter += 1
end

# My intuition would tell me this sets the default value of id to 1,
# for all subsequence calls; but in fact it calls get_id whenever
# print_id is called without a parameter.
def print_id(id=get_id)
  puts id
end

print_id() # =&gt; 1
print_id() # =&gt; 2
</code></pre>

<p>Whether that meshes with your intuition or not, I suspect at least <em>some</em> devs share my feeling here. Obviously, once you know how it works, you get it. So as I&#39;ve already conceded, maybe this isn&#39;t a good reason. That&#39;s why I saved the best for last!</p>

<h2>Reason 3: The idiomatic way often leads to nil errors</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s the main one. I like my approach using <code>||=</code> because it lets you pass in <code>nil</code> to the method and treats this the same as if you hadn&#39;t passed in the parameter at all. (I just realized: maybe I like this because it reminds me of JavaScript with <code>undefined</code>!)</p>

<p>Surely some of you are shaking your heads, thinking that&#39;s awful because you&#39;d like your methods to be able accept <code>nil</code> and do something meaningful with that. At the risk of sounding like I&#39;m making an absurd blanket statement, let me just say: I&#39;m <em>skeptical</em>. When do you write a method with intentionally different behavior for passing in <code>nil</code> as opposed to not passing anything? Maybe I&#39;m just not thinking hard enough, but no reasonable cases for this come to my mind.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t mean to suggest that given my definition of <code>foo</code> above, it would make sense to pass in <code>nil</code> explicitly:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby"># Why would I do this?
foo(nil)
</code></pre>

<p>Rather, I find that these <code>nil</code> errors creep up in scenarios where you&#39;re passing the output of one method directly into another:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">foo(get_some_data())
</code></pre>

<p>In the above case, it might (arguably) sometimes make sense for <code>get_some_data</code> to return <code>nil</code>&mdash;or anyway, whether or not it makes <em>sense</em> it might <em>happen</em>&mdash;and in that case <code>options</code> will be <code>nil</code> rather than a default value.</p>

<p>One way to solve this is to use <code>||</code> at the call site:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">foo(get_some_data() || DEFAULT_OPTIONS)
</code></pre>

<p>But now you&#39;ve duplicated your logic for falling back to a sensible default. And what are you going to do, add this special handling at every point where <code>foo</code> is called with a parameter that might be <code>nil</code>? Unsustainable!</p>

<p>So this is the final and best reason why I prefer <em>my</em> way over Ruby&#39;s built-in way. Thoughtful questions, comments, and vitriol all welcome.</p>
