<h1>Using Gravatar as a random backdrop</h1>

<p>The backdrop that fades in when you visit <a href="http://danieltao.com">danieltao.com</a> is a random identicon generated by Gravatar. I get it by generating a completely <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/hash/">random hash</a> and then creating an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element with its <code>src</code> attribute set to the corresponding <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/">image request URL</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m almost <em>certain</em> there is a less hacky and more &quot;correct&quot; way of doing something like this. However, it was actually quite easy and I thought it was fun.</p>
