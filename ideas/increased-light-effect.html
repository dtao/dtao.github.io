            <h1>An "increased light" effect in CSS</h1>
            <p>I had this idea for an effect where it looks like an increased amount of light is cast at the user&#39;s screen (like, from where the user is sitting). Mainly this would entail perceived shadows receding and possibly the background color getting brighter.</p>

<p>As it turns out, this was possible to do <em>almost</em> without JavaScript. You can see the effect in <a href="/intros/increased-light">this intro to danieltao.com</a>: when you hover over one of the links, the whole screen sort of glows brighter.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how I got it to work. The difference in light is accomplished via the CSS properties <code>background-color</code> (duh) and <code>box-shadow</code>. I position a wrapper element with fixed positioning so that its borders are actually larger than the screen&#39;s:</p>

<pre><code class="css">#shadow {
  position: fixed;
  top: -50%;
  bottom: -50%;
  left: -50%;
  right: -50%;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I add the property <code>box-shadow: inset 0 0 [blur radius] [spread radius] #000</code>, where <em>blur radius</em> and <em>spread radius</em> are 50% the size of the screen (where by &quot;size&quot; I mean the lesser of height and width--so that the shadow isn&#39;t overpowering). Unfortunately since the <code>box-shadow</code> property doesn&#39;t support pixel values for the radii this is where I needed to utilize JavaScript: by dynamically calculating these values on initial page load and subsequently whenever the window is resized.</p>

<p>Now, what about the hovering? Surprisingly enough, JavaScript was <em>not</em> needed for this part. I put the <code>#shadow</code> element after the navigation links and used the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_selectors">general sibling selector</a> to modify the style of the element occurring <em>after</em> the <code>a:hover</code> selector:</p>

<pre><code class="css">a:hover ~ #shadow {
  background-color: #fff;
  box-shadow: none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Actually, I also use JavaScript to change that style from <code>box-shadow: none;</code> to one with smaller blur and spread radii as with the no-hover case. But using <code>none</code> works too; it just looks a little less cool in my opinion.)</p>
