Using Gravatar as a random backdrop
===================================

The backdrop that fades in when you visit [danieltao.com](http://danieltao.com) is a random identicon generated by Gravatar. I get it by generating a completely [random hash](https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/hash/) and then creating an `<img>` element with its `src` attribute set to the corresponding [image request URL](https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/).

I'm almost *certain* there is a less hacky and more "correct" way of doing something like this. However, it was actually quite easy and I thought it was fun.
