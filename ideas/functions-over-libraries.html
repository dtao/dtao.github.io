            <h1>Functions over (JavaScript) libraries</h1>
            <p>I should preface this by saying I barely know what I&rsquo;m talking about. I haven&rsquo;t bothered to learn
the ins and outs, or even the rationale (in full), of any JavaScript module pattern/library/toolkit
such as CommonJS, AMD, etc.</p>

<p>That said, here&rsquo;s an opinion I just wanted to sort of float out there. It&rsquo;s something I idly
suggested to some of my old ThoughtWorks colleagues back in the day, with generally lukewarm
responses. I attribute that to my failure to explain the idea very well (a failure I may very well
repeat right now).</p>

<h2>The library-based paradigm</h2>

<p>Recently a couple of libraries have undertaken the major task of modularization. I&rsquo;m not sure if
that&rsquo;s a &ldquo;word&rdquo;; but it should be clear enough what I mean: breaking down their various
functionalities into individually consumable parts. <a href="http://lodash.com/">Lo-Dash</a> is the one I&rsquo;m
most acutely aware of because I follow <a href="https://twitter.com/jdalton">@jdalton</a> on Twitter and he&rsquo;s
been pretty vocal lately about their efforts on this front.</p>

<p>I think this is a great thing. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the <em>best</em> thing.</p>

<p>What I think would be even better is this: fewer big libraries, more standalone functions.</p>

<p>The whole reason we see this modularization is that there are devs who want very specific
functionality; and maybe it&rsquo;s trivial to write it yourself, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to have
standard,  battle-tested implementations that we all share? And so maybe I want an <code>extend()</code> method
to add a bunch of properties to an object. And I want a nice robust one, with validation and bells
and whistles. So I pull in Lo-Dash, or Underscore, or whatever, just for that one method.</p>

<p>Boo hoo, now I&rsquo;ve got a big library dependency for something so small. So again: I get it. Being
able to depend on <em>just</em> Lo-Dash:extend is a good thing.</p>

<p>But <strong>why does Lo-Dash need to be so big in the first place?</strong> Why <em>was</em> it huge, and now the team
has broken it down into smaller consumable pieces? Why wasn&rsquo;t there just an <code>extend()</code> library (more
like &ldquo;library&rdquo;)&ndash;with none of the other stuff in Lo-Dash&ndash;to begin with?</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a rhetorical question. I think I know the answer: because our whole ecosystem is designed
around the concept of a library.</p>

<h2>How developers share code</h2>

<p>There are two ways that developers share their code today. One is by publishing &ldquo;projects&rdquo;, which
are repositories (increasingly Git repositories hosted on GitHub) containing potentially lots of
functionality. Sure, some of these are small; but the norm is that they are pretty large. And around
this paradigm there arise package management solutions like RubyGems, NPM, NuGet, Maven. I&rsquo;m
guessing most devs would view this as the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to share code.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the other way, which I think most devs would consider a &ldquo;hacky&rdquo; or just flat-out &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; way
to share code: by posting snippets online, for others to copy/paste. This is the stuff of
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> answers, blog posts, and
<a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a>.</p>

<p>The second way is perceived as hacky because it isn&rsquo;t very standardized. There are no package
managers (that I&rsquo;m aware of) that scour StackOverflow. But here&rsquo;s what I like about the second way:
<strong>the units of code are very small</strong>. Nobody posts a &ldquo;library&rdquo; in a StackOverflow answer. Typically
the OP has a problem, and helpful users propose solutions to that specific problem in the form of a
single function (or a handful of tightly-coupled functions).</p>

<p>Imagine if we had an ecosystem where instead of a &ldquo;package&rdquo; being a library, a &ldquo;package&rdquo; was just a
function.</p>

<h2>A proposal for a function-based paradigm</h2>

<p>Actually, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d really like to see: somebody defines an abstract piece of functionality.
They give it a name, a description, and (ideally) some unit tests. Now any developer can take a
crack at implementing it. Implementations get submitted to a registry, where they are classified
under this abstract functionality. Subsequently, other developers can require the functionality on
their projects.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a concrete example. Let&rsquo;s say I need a function to split an array into chunks of size N.
Maybe our hypothetical registry includes an entry called &ldquo;chunk&rdquo;; I look it up, read the
description, and decide that&rsquo;s exactly what I need. (Or, I don&rsquo;t find it; so I write up a
description myself and submit that.)</p>

<p>Now, there are a few implementations of this already registered: one by dtao, one by jschmoe, and
one by jqpublic. I could <code>require(&#39;chunk/dtao&#39;)</code> to get dtao&rsquo;s implementation; or I could just
<code>require(&#39;chunk/*&#39;)</code> to get whatever the &ldquo;best&rdquo; one is (determined, say, via some voting mechanism,
or just by download count).</p>

<p>Note that there&rsquo;s nothing stopping these functions from requiring one another. So we could still
have something similar to libraries. Maybe we could even group together a whole bunch of functions
under some umbrella term and brand it, so you could still have <code>require(&#39;lodash&#39;)</code> or whatever, as a
convenient shortcut for requiring lots of functionality. But by default, everything would be much
more fine-grained than it is today.</p>

<p>Now you might say, &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s exactly what these libraries have done by modularizing, so what are
you protesting?&rdquo; My issue is that these libraries&ndash;Lo-Dash, and I believe jQuery as well&ndash;shouldn&rsquo;t
have to put all this effort into what they&rsquo;re doing. They&rsquo;re swimming upstream, fighting against the
norm that we currently have. I&rsquo;m proposing that if we lived in a world where the standard unit of
code were a <em>function</em>, not a library, they wouldn&rsquo;t find themselves in this mess.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am clearly the pot calling the kettle black here as I have <a href="https://github.com/dtao?tab=repositories">my own share of JavaScript
libraries</a> which are in no way modularized. But I would
still like to see this happen. It&rsquo;s in the back of my mind as something I may attempt to get off the
ground at some point in the future.</p>
