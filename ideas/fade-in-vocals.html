            <h1>Fade-in vocals</h1>
            <p>There is a certain effect in some of the music I listen to that used to intrigue me. It was the sound of the singer&#39;s vocals fading <em>in</em>, as if they were coming to you through some ethereal dimension. I wondered how it was done.</p>

<p>I figured it out at some point. It&#39;s actually quite simple: you <em>reverse</em> the vocal track, apply reverb to it, then reverse it back. I&#39;ve used it several times in my music; here&#39;s an example where I go a little crazy with it (it&#39;s present through the entire song).</p>

<p>Obviously, a computer makes this a lot easier. It must have been a pretty tedious thing back in the days of recording to tape. But maybe there&#39;s another way to do it that I haven&#39;t thought of.</p>
